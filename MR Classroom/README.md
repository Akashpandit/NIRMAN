# Tech Stack: 
<ul>
  <li>Unity 3D Engine</li>
  <li>Vuforia AR SDK</li>
  <li>AR Core & AR Foundation Libraries</li>
  <li>C# language</li>
  <li>Blender</li>
 </ul>
 
# Misc:
<ul>
  <li>Since development in Unity can be no code, so is our solution. Thus, the demo working videos of the app are provided in the GDrive link.</li>
  <li>Our marketing strategy is realised based on the fact that education giants such as BUYJU's would dive into AR/VR next. Thus, there would be huge competition, so the solution we are thinking is worth checking out.</li>
  <li>We focus our HR on hiring creatives such as 3D modelers, game developers, content creators, subject matter experts, etc who are needed for developing the extensive app content. This is because creatives section in the society is facing negligence and not getting the opportunities they deserve.
