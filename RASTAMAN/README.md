# Problem statement

Avoiding accidents through driver assistive model.

## Solution Approach

By using distance sensor. It alerts the driver if the vehicle is nearing a median 
We use photo sensor, It will reduce the hazard caused due to misuse of the high beam by lowering high beam to low beam.
When some big vehicles are try to cross the median at this time some small vehicles are interfering . so we’ll use a distance sensor . so it’ll alert when  some vehicle interfere. 
Using Sonar sensor we measure the distance of median from the vehicle . From the data we can check whether the vehicle is closing to a median or not . By doing this we can alert the driver. 
Same technique is being used to get an idea of the blind spot whether there is any object or vehicle while taking a U-turn and also tell whether the vehicle will hit the median while taking a U-turn or not.
