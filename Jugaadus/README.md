## Problem Statement
Studies have been a very integral part of the lives of college students. But, time too stands as an important factor thereby. Everyone is busy completing those 24hrs in a day be it in the form of studying, developing new skills, completing assignments etc.. The thing they lack is to have a check on their valuable time spent and manage all related activities accordingly.

## Solution Approach
Our portal focusses on some very important factors of any student like Academics, ense Management and Bookmarks.
In the academics section, a student can browse the contents like notes, previous year question papers, popular online courses or lectures on YouTube and other platforms and much more. The students can even upload their notes on the portal and the same can be accessed by other users. This section will also contain a list of some important competitions (branch specific) going in and around the city along with a discussion forum. 
It's important for a student to take care of the day to day expenses so that the limited budget can be managed efficiently throughout the month. The Manage Expenses section of the portal would help the student to keep a track of all the expenses on a daily basis and give a report of the weekly/monthly expenses with the help of which the student can get a better idea of where to spend and where not to.
In the watchlist section, a student can add bookmarks or links to contents of various categories like academics, entertainment or anything based on their interest.
